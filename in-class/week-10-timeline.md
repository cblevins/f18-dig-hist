## Making a Timeline

### Introduction

[Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) is a lightweight, popular tool for creating web-based timelines. It doesn't allow a ton of customization but it has a comparatively shallow learning curve. Here is an example of a historian's timeline built with this tool: <http://teaching.erinbush.org/f17h390/donner-party-timeline/>

In this exercise, you'll make a collaborative timeline of events in the history of feminism in the United States.

### Part I: Get to Know the Data

You're going to collaboratively create a timeline of a handful of events in the history of first-, second-, third-, and fourth-wave feminism in the United States. You'll be using Wikipedia as your major source of information, which helpfully has a different pages dedicated to each of these waves.

- First-Wave Feminism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism#Timeline>
- Second-Wave Feminism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_second-wave_feminism>
- Third-Wave Feminism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism#Timeline>
- Fourth-Wave Feminism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-wave_feminism#Timeline>

Divide up the pages in your group. Each of you needs to familiarize yourself with the data. What kind of events does it include? How is the information formatted?


You're going to then use an existing template that I started for you: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-WRd1mSo_3BLt9UAmrYjsLWZoUZXVU5s0ldQxtnX74/edit#gid=0>.

Look at the spreadsheet. As a group, **make sure everyone knows what each column means**. If you can't figure one of them out, ask me.

### Part II: Add the Data

Each person then chooses **two events** from their respective page to add to the timeline. Begin adding as much information as you can into each column. 

Before moving to Part III, make sure everyone is finished and compare your different rows. Are there discrepancies between them? If so, how would you resolve them?

### Part III: Present the Data

Now you're going to embed the timeline into your personal webpage. To do so, first go to: <https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make>. Go to Step 3 and copy and paste the URL of the Google Spreadsheet. Preview the timeline at the end of the page to see what it looks like. Try changing some of the optional settings.

Then go to the following tutorial and follow the instructions *starting with* "Embedding Your Timeline into your WordPress Site": <http://teaching.erinbush.org/tutorial-creating-narrative-timeline-timeline-js/>
